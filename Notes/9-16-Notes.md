Requirements Engineering
requirement engineering can be characterized as an iterative process of discovery 
and analysis designed to produce an agreed upon set of clear, complete, 
and consistent system requirements.
A typical requirement system (RS):
RS1: a person can enter his profile
RS2: a person can edit x
etc
Q: Who can verify the requirements?
Stakeholders  : Any person or organization who has a stake in said enterprise
end user, service provider, developer, etc...
Q: How to verify requirements?
represent requirements by DFD diagrams, uml diagrams, text, or ic cards and review them carefully
