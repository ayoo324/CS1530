team organization:
using democratic approach,
best for small teams
min amount is two people

roles:
management, development, crossfuctional, consultant, promotor

ideas for our project:
Database programmer, network programmer, compression engineer, signal engineer

Task analysis:
	last time:
	functions - what the customer/user would like to have
	ex. select items, place in cart, check out, promotional deals
	tasks - developer viewpoint
	ex. GUI, database, etc
create matrix:
	functions	select items, place in cart, checkout, promotional deals etc
tasks
GUI
Database
etc

Risk Management -
	risk and cost are inversely related
	more money -> reduce risk
	cutting cost -> cut corners -> increase risk
Identifying Risks
	Technical Risk - ex. performance
	Managerial Risk - involves people -> ex. delivery too late
Mitigating Risks -
	Technical mitigation strategy -> performance evaluation, improve hardware or code
	Managerial mitigation strategy -> review progress, status report, etc

Boehm's top 10 risk items -
personnel shortfalls
unrealistic schedules
unrealistic budgets 
developing wrong software functions
developing wrong interface
unnecessary perfectionism
continuous requirement changes
shortfalls in outsourced tasks or components
realtime performance shortfalls
straining computer science capabilities

most important - the program works!

for next milestone and quiz!
Costing Techniques -
	Estimate cost by looking at functions and tasks
	LOC cost table
	estimate size of programs -> how many lines of code?
on a quiz, he'll give us a LOC cost table partially filled -> fill out the rest
LE = (a + 4m + b)/6 
LD = (b-a)/6
Ld = sum(((b-a)/6)^2)^0.5
	Labor Cost/Task Technique
	Cost matrix derived from experience

COCOMO - Constructive cost model
good for large scale software projects
E = (a + bS^c)m(x1, x2, xn) 
E is effort in person-months, S is the estimated system size (LOC), a b c are constants, m is the cost multiplier, x1 2 3 are the cost attributes

Cost and Risk
lower cost, higher risk
higher cost, lower risk
risk can also be reduced by increasing our efforts ( costs, resources, person-months)
cannot reduce delivery time by adding people
